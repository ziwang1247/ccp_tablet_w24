            <p class = "quote">“I love a runny, fluffy omelette, but they can leave you feeling hungry. This one feels like a real meal with its fried rice filling. It’s perfect to use up any leftover veg from the fridge or freezer and is ready in no time.”</p> 

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class = "ingredients-container">
                <li>3 tsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>50g bacon, chopped</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup leftover cooked sushi rice</li>
                <li>2/3 cup (80g) frozen corn and pea mix</li>
                <li>1 tbs tomato sauce</li>
                <li>3 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tbs milk</li>
                <li>Tonkatsu sauce, toasted sesame seeds and finely chopped and sliced red chilli, to serve</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class = "step-container">
                <li>Heat 1 tsp oil in a large frypan over medium-high heat. Cook bacon, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes or until golden. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened. Add rice and vegetables and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until warmed through. Add tomato and soy sauce and stir-fry for 1 minute or until well combined. Cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl until smooth. Heat a medium non-stick frypan over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tsp oil and swirl to coat pan. Pour half the egg mixture into the hot pan and immediately whisk egg mixture with 2 chopsticks in a small circular pattern until there is a thin base of cooked egg but remaining egg is still slightly runny. Remove from heat and slide out onto a serving plate. Spoon half the rice and vegetable mixture along centre, then fold egg up over slightly to cover.</li>
                <li>Repeat to make a second omelette. Drizzle with tonkatsu sauce, sprinkle with sesame seeds and chilli, and serve.</li>

            <p class = "quote">“Ice-cold beer and chicken katsu don – doesn’t get much better! I like to serve my katsu with some chilli oil for a kick of heat."</p> 

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class = "ingredients-container">
                <li>1 1/2 cups (330g) sushi rice</li>
                <li>2 small (about 500g) free-range chicken breasts</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (75g) plain flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (75g) panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1 tbs red miso paste</li>
                <li>Sunflower oil, to shallow fry</li>
                <li>4 long green shallots, white part finely chopped, green part shredded</li>
                <li>Shredded toasted nori sheets & black sesame seeds, to serve</li>
                <li>2 tbs rice wine vinegar</li>

                <li>1/4 wombok cabbage (about 325g), shredded</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class = "step-container">
                <li>Cook the sushi rice according to packet instructions. Set aside, covered, and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to create 4 thin pieces. Whisk 2 of the eggs in a medium bowl, and place flour and panko breadcrumbs in 2 separate bowls. Dust each piece of chicken in flour, dip in the whisked egg, then cover in breadcrumbs, pressing to coat the chicken completely. Place on a tray and chill for 10 minutes to firm.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine miso paste with 3/4 cup (180ml) of boiling water in a jug, stir, and set aside.</li>
                <li>For the cabbage salad, place sunflower oil, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add cabbage, toss to coat and set aside until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Heat 2cm of sunflower oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Working in batches, fry chicken for 5-6 minutes, turning once, until golden. Drain on paper towel and season. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add half the miso broth and half the whites of the long green shallot to a clean, large frypan and bring to a boil. Beat the remaining 2 eggs together in a jug. Place two of the chicken pieces in the pan and carefully pour over half the beaten egg on and around chicken. Turn up the heat to medium-high, cover and cook for 3 minutes or until egg is just set. Using a wide fish slice, scoop up chicken katsu and some of the egg and remove from pan and chop each piece into 5 even slices. Repeat with remaining chicken, miso, shallot and egg.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine 1 tbs sunflower oil, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil in a small bowl. Season, then toss through cabbage.</li>
                <li>Divide warm rice among serving bowls and top with 5 slices of chicken and some cabbage. Scatter over shredded long green shallot, nori and sesame seeds, to serve.</li>
